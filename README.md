Developing Data Products.

The Shiny app allows a user to investigate a sampling of datasets in the "datasets" library on R, specifically by being able to see
a summary of the contents and the first "n" specified observations of their choice.
The datasets that can be viewed in this app are the following: rock, cars, pressure, iris, mtcars, airquality, quakes.

They can then use these summaries to plan out their analysis.
